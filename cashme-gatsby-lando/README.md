  Gatsby's default starter in Lando environment
</h1>

Kick off your project with this default boilerplate. This starter ships with the main Gatsby configuration files you might need to get up and running blazing fast with the blazing fast app generator for React.

_Have another more specific idea? You may want to check out our vibrant collection of [official and community-created starters](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/gatsby-starters/)._

## 🚀 Quick start

1.  **Create a Gatsby site in Lando local environment.**

    Use the [Lando](https://docs.devwithlando.io/) to create a new site with default starter. Install [Lando release >RC1](https://github.com/lando/lando/releases) beforehand.

    ```sh
    # Clone the Gatsby default starter with Lando setup.
    git clone git@github.com:tormi/gatsby-starter-lando.git
    ```

1.  **Start developing.**

    Navigate into your new site’s directory and start it up. For yarn and gatsby commands use prefix `lando`, for example `lando yarn`, `lando gatsby ...`. 

    ```sh
    cd gatsby-starter-lando/
    # Start Lando and `gatsby develop`.
    lando start
    ```

1.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://gatsby.lndo.site`!

    _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://gatsby.lndo.site/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._

    Open the `gatsby-starter-lando` directory in your code editor of choice and edit `src/pages/index.js`. Save your changes and the browser will update in real time!

## 🧐 What's inside?

A quick look at the top-level files and directories you'll see in a Gatsby project.

    .
    ├── src
    ├── .gitignore
    ├── .lando.yml
    ├── gatsby-browser.js
    ├── gatsby-config.js
    ├── gatsby-node.js
    ├── gatsby-ssr.js
    ├── LICENSE
    ├── package.json
    ├── README.md
    └── yarn.lock

1.  **`/src`**: This directory will contain all of the code related to what you will see on the front-end of your site (what you see in the browser) such as your site header or a page template. `src` is a convention for “source code”.

1.  **`.gitignore`**: This file tells git which files it should not track / not maintain a version history for.

1.  **`.lando.yml`**: This is the configuration file for [Lando](https://docs.devwithlando.io/) environment setup.

1.  **`gatsby-browser.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby browser APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/browser-apis/) (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting the browser.

1.  **`gatsby-config.js`**: This is the main configuration file for a Gatsby site. This is where you can specify information about your site (metadata) like the site title and description, which Gatsby plugins you’d like to include, etc. (Check out the [config docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/gatsby-config/) for more detail).

1.  **`gatsby-node.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby Node APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/node-apis/) (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting pieces of the site build process.

1.  **`gatsby-ssr.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby server-side rendering APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/ssr-apis/) (if any). These allow customization of default Gatsby settings affecting server-side rendering.

1.  **`LICENSE`**: Gatsby is licensed under the MIT license.

1. **`package.json`**: A manifest file for Node.js projects, which includes things like metadata (the project’s name, author, etc). This manifest is how npm knows which packages to install for your project.

1. **`README.md`**: A text file containing useful reference information about your project.

1. **`yarn.lock`** (See `package.json` below, first). This is an automatically generated file based on the exact versions of your yarn dependencies that were installed for your project. **(You won’t change this file directly).**
